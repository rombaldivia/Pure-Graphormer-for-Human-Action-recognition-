## Advantages
  
-  Token Dropout and progressive unfreezing exposed through the CLI.
  
-  Resume from any checkpoint with --resume best_graphormer.pth.
  
-  Live LR hot-reload via hyper_lr.txt — no need to restart training.
  
-  Automatic confusion matrix and loss curves saved under ./metrics/.
  
-  Stratified 70 / 20 / 10 split helper in tools/split_ntu.py.
  
-  Multi-GPU support (DataParallel) and AMP mixed-precision ready.
